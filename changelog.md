# SuperMario Tweaker v2.2.0 - Changelog 

üîÑUpdates:
- Add `action button` to clear GPU cache
- Clean unnecessary tweaks in SuperMario-Tweaker.sh script
- Change how module work
- improvements here and there

üõ†Ô∏èFixes:
- Touch & Input
  - Removed fine-tuned touch calibrations: pressure scaling, size scaling/bias, distance calibration and scaling.
  - Removed limits on multitouch event rate (windowsmgr.max_events_per_sec).
  - These affect touch sensitivity, accuracy, and UI responsiveness.

- GPU & Graphics:
  - Removed increased GPU buffer count (debug.egl.buffcount=4) which can improve frame buffering.
  - Removed several SurfaceFlinger optimizations like disabling crop recompute and backpressure.
  - Removed disabling of partial invalidates (debug.hwui.render_dirty_regions=false), impacting rendering efficiency.

- Vsync and Frame Sync:
  - Removed disabling of vsync (debug.hwui.disable_vsync=true and debug.cpurend.vsync=false) to reduce screen tearing and improve frame timing.
  - Removed swap interval tweaks (debug.egl.swapinterval=0 and debug.gr.swapinterval=0) affecting frame pacing.

- System Stability and Memory:
  - Removed disabling of killing resource-heavy tasks (debug.kill_allocating_task=0) which helps free memory.
  - Removed disabling process limit (ENFORCE_PROCESS_LIMIT=false), avoiding system overload.

- Visual Quality:
  - Removed disabling of dithering and MSAA forcing, which can degrade visual quality.

- Gaming & Display:
  - Removed disabling of Game Mode (persist.sys.game.turbo=0), potentially reducing gaming performance boosts.
  - Removed forced 120Hz refresh rate and dynamic FPS settings, which save battery but can limit smoothness.
